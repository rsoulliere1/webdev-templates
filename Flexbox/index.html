                <p><img id="bio-image" src="images/me-vr-oldphoto.png" alt:"Robert VR">For over 20 years I have worked in higher education. I obtained my Masters Degree from the University of Western Ontario in 1997. After my Master's, I lived and worked in South Korea, Palestine and the United States. From 1999 until 2007, I worked at a Texas Christian University. 
                I worked there first as a Librarian, then as the Assistant Director of International Student Services. 
                I have been at Mohawk College since 2007, where I have served as a Librarian and Professor. In 2019, 
                I graduated with the first cohort of the AR/VR program at Mohawk College. I have been involved in
                 many virtual reality initiatives over the past year.</p>
                
                 <p>I have experience programming in many languages, including JavaScript, Python and C#. 
                I enjoy game and XR development using the Unity and Godot game. I also enjoy 3D modelling and
                 animation using Blender and 3dsMax. I always like discussing ideas about the use of augmented 
                 and virtual reality for entertainment and education.</p></div>
